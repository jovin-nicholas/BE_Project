# Assessing Industrial Readiness of Students by Leveraging Soft-Skill Parameters
This repo contains the ML models of our B.Eng. in Computer Engineering Final Year Project

## Description
The aim of this project is to minimize the significant gap between students' skills and industry requirements by analyzing and improving students' soft skill parameters. This will be achieved through a series of questionnaires designed to assess ten fundamental soft skill parameters: organizational skills, leadership skills, communication, time management, teamwork, problem-solving, self-management, decision-making, self-confidence, and creativity. These skills are essential to enhance students' prospects of securing a job in their desired domain.
